# The Evacuation (0-5 AE)

871 years ago the world as people knew it ended. One day, in towns and villages all around the world, came airships from the skies telling people that they needed to come with them and evacuate. The first people aboard were the truly desperate and poor, since who would abandon stability and wealth just because some ship's captain said there was a nebulous threat?

By the time the ships returned the first wisps of fog had started to lay across the land. By the fourth time, some ships had difficulty landing. By the sixth and last roundtrip people were clinging onto the ships wherever they could as [the Mist](/general/the_mist) lay thick across the land. Many ships did not return from the last trip, and a few have been found on the surface, desperate people still clinging on.

The people were delivered to [Skyhaven](/places/skyhaven) where very little except what is now the Town Hall awaited them. The next five years were a flurry of activity as a small town was established and the ships that survived the evacuation mapped the area.

Much is lost about the time before the Evacuation, written records were very rarely brought up during the Evacuation itself, and in the years after writing was rarely a priority.
