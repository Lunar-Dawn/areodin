::: details Arvodin & Hesri
Neither Arvodin nor Hesri knows much of who their families were or what happened to them, only that Hesri came to the orphanage before Arvodin, making her the older sibling. There they both lived out most of their childhoods together, performing the ritual to become [blood-siblings](/places/trit_shi#blood-siblings) at 12 years of age.

After leaving their orphanage they both bounced around odd jobs before they both started working together as bodyguards and guides for merchants and industrialists on their way around town, especially those less familiar with the town. They eventually tired of leading rich people around the city and left to found the Watani Company.
