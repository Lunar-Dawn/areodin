# Eletha Keldi
<Badge type="info" text="She/Her"/>

A relatively young (by Elven standards at least) woman, Eletha is a zoologist and faculty head at the [Areodin Academy](/places/academy). Her expertise and "claim to fame" lies in her analysis of how surface animals have adapted to their new environment after they arrived in the skies and her work in utilising these changes for people's benefit.

Yet still, her inclusion on the crew is somewhat strange. Bringing a zoologist along is not that unexpected at all, but one of the foremost ones, and a faculty head at that, is highly unusual. Perhaps she too has an in as to what spurred [Victoria](./victoria) to organise the expedition in the first place.
