# Second Mate Sarah Goldlily
<Badge type="info" text="She/Her"/>

Sarah comes from the Goldlily family, one of the few families that both still trace their lineage to nobility and have the influence for it to matter. But why such a noblewoman is on the ship is a mystery, and she has specifically requested that no one reveals her family name while off the ship. Her experience with leadership and martial matters makes her an expert commander. Her steadfastness and commanding presence amongst the crew will be vital when events, as they always do in the skies, turn to misfortune.
