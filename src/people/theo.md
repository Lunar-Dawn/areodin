# Captain's Steward Theo Simdas
<Badge type="info" text="They/Them"/>

A newcomer to the crew and to the skies Theo was recruited from Luin where they grew up. An accountant by trade, Theo has no real experience with ships and has found it hard to adapt to the crowding and swaying. Only time will tell how well they'll adapt to their new job and locale but their bookkeeping skills come highly recommended.
