# Elja Kranz
<Badge type="info" text="She/They"/>

Born to tavernkeepers in the harbour district of Skyhaven Elja has been used to roughhousing sailors since a very young age and worked in the tavern almost since she was old enough to walk. For the entire time she was working at the tavern she was fascinated by the stories of valour and exploration brought in by the sailors, especially the rare few times a [Gryphon Knight](/general/gryphon_knights) dropped in.

Eventually, she started training for combat on her off time, aiming for joining the Knights eventually. But in the meantime, she's come to the attention of the Watani siblings and joined them to train in real combat.
