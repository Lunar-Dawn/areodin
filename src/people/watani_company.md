::: details The Watani Company
The Watani Company is a small mercenary group consisting of [Arvodin](./arvodin) & [Hesri Watani](./hesri) and [Elja Kranz](./elja) operating out of [Trit-Shi](/places/trit_shi) that primarily work as guards aboard foraging and scavenging ships doing trips into the reaches of Areodin.

The company was founded by Arvodin & Hesri, [blood-siblings](/places/trit_shi#blood-siblings) from Trit-Shi who wanted to use the combat skills they had gained in more legitimate ways as sell-swords.

Elja didn't join the company until many years later when she singlehandedly cleared out half a dozen ruffians in the inn the Watanis had been staying in. Seeing her skills even without any proper combat training the siblings quickly recruited her into the company, trained her up, and she's stayed in ever since.
