# First Mate's Steward Ironhearth Brocard
<Badge type="info" text="He/Him"/>

Brocard is Ragnar's eternal shadow, rarely leaving his side. Unexpectedly for everyone, him included, the skittish halfling followed Ragnar into the military when he signed up; During his time there Brocard served as a support specialist and spotter on the field. Now as a part of the officer corps, he serves as secretary to Ragnar, running errands and messages for him. A timid but eternal workhorse Brocard will be essential to the operation of the ship and crew.
