# Lily
<Badge type="info" text="She/Her"/>

Lily is a seamstress's daughter but has very little interest in it herself. More inclined to healing she's joined as a nurse, and sometimes deep in the night, singer. She's the only one in the trio not to be purely human, having a hint of angelic blood in her veins, granting her her magical abilities. A gentle and diplomatic person she moderates the stubborn and headfast girls she's grown up with, and she'll be a welcome caring hand for any injured crew.
