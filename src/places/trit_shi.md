# Trit-Shi

One of the biggest islands not to have a specialised [crystal](/general/island_crystals) supporting it, Trit-Shi would be a large but otherwise unremarkable city-island if not for its demographics.

## Geography

Trit-Shi is situated on a fairly normal grassy island, the outer half dedicated to crop farming and some animal husbandry. Somewhat unusually the island has a small lake on it, large enough for rowboats and a small fishing industry.

## History

The history of Trit-Shi cannot be separated from the history of Seseria, the pre-Evacuation homeland of the Sesani, and the history of the tieflings who would eventually settle there.

### Old Sesaria

For most of history, Seseria was an unremarkable medium-sized, mostly human, nation nestled in a large forested valley down on the surface.

That was until the year 453 BE, when the goblin & hobgoblin Horde of Raskar White-eye invaded. His armies swept across the valley, aided by nobles willing to surrender for their own lives, burning most of it to the ground. Sesarian sovereignty was only restored three decades later when a group of adventurers fought their way through the armies and slew Raskar himself.

### Old-world tieflings

Most of recorded history before the Evacuation was not kind to the tieflings. Most states and peoples viewed the birth of a tiefling child as a curse having been placed on the family. Most tieflings were thus abandoned as newborn babies and, if lucky, raised by tiefling communities in slums outside cities. Outright organised violence against them was rare, but not unheard of.

With the severing of family ties from their abandonment, the tieflings of the old world made their own family structure. The entire community in their home was their family and those whom they grew up with (often simply those abandoned close to the same time), became [blood-siblings](#blood-siblings).

### New Sesaria

As the dust settled after the goblinoid horde was expelled, Sesaria was devastated, reduced to a fifth of its previous population. With most of the previous population either dead or unwilling to return some new idea was needed to repopulate, and one of the heroes who slew Raskar. A tiefling herself she sent for heralds to visit every tiefling exclave they could find around the world, promising them a new home and farmland to work if they made the journey.

The campaign was a success beyond measure, in only a few years the population was restored above pre-horde levels, and a new society was building.

The scars of both the horde and the treatment of the tieflings formed the foundation of the new Sesarian society and political system, establishing one of the world's first true democracies. Sesarian, and later Trit-Shi, society is both fiercely protective of each person's individuality, but also strongly encourages everyone to work for each other.

### Post-Evacuation

Trit-Shi was initially settled in the year 18 AE by a group of Sesani who felt that their culture, which they had fought tooth and nail to establish in the old world was being swept away by the new unified Areodin culture developing on Skyhaven.

## Economy and Population

Trit-Shi is inhabited by the Sesani, a group of tieflings who had established their own state before [the Evacuation](/history/evacuation). With their separate culture and language (and non-tieflings sticking out a lot) making outsider immigration rare the Sesani still make up over 95% of the island population.

The economy of Trit-Shi is focused mainly around three pillars: fishing, firearms, and tourism. With a population as large as Trit-Shi's there is no shortage of other trades, tailors, smiths, bakers, and scholars are still needed, but the big three are what outsiders know the island for and the pride of the locals.

### Fishing

With the inefficiency and thus rarity and expense of animal husbandry the large lake on Trit-Shi has proven an extremely valuable resource. A great deal of effort of put into raising, feeding, and harvesting fish in the lake, and then into preserving and shipping the fish out to other islands. Dried and salted fish from Trit-Shi is a vital morale-boosting high-protein food found on almost every sky-ship in Areodin.

### Firearms

A throughline from the Sesani nation before the Evacuation, the Trit-Shi firearms industry is famed around all of Areodin. Focusing on the personal firearms the Sesani pioneered the adoption of, a Sesani rifle or pistol is considered the highest quality ones you can find.

### Tourism

Although Sesani culture has drifted considerably closer to the rest of Areodin over the centuries it still has a (now somewhat inaccurate) reputation for exoticism, attracting visitors from all over. Significant parts of the city are filled with visitor accommodations and entertainment willing to exaggerate Sesani culture if it parts visitors from a bit of their coin.

## Blood-siblings

A very old tradition, The Rite of Blood Bonding is a ritual where unrelated people swear an oath of family to each other. The tradition emerged when tieflings were outcasts in the old world. Since many of them were often abandoned by their family at young ages it became a tradition to find your own family amongst other tieflings. 

Since tieflings are no longer stigmatised or abandoned, the tradition is mostly carried on by orphans who seek the same family and belonging, but Sesani wedding ceremonies do carry traces of the ritual's influence. Even so, the Sesani take the bonds of the rite *very* seriously and suggesting them as lesser is viewed as a grave insult.
