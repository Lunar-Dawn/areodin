# The Chita Observatory

The only settlement in Areodin to not be on a floating island the Chita Observatory serves as a navigational aid and research outpost.

## Geography

The observatory is situated atop one of the tallest mountain peaks on the surface. Its connection to the surface has mandated high walls and a constant military presence lest [Mist-Beasts](/general/the_mist#mist-beasts) overwhelm it.

## History

The observatory was established by the eponymous Chita Selake by simply anchoring a spare airship to the mountain peak. The establishment of a fixed point revolutionised navigation and mapmaking in all of Areodin.

Since then construction has spread to the peak of the mountain, and permanent habitation is now possible.

## Economy and Population

The Chita Observatory is inhabited almost only by researchers and military personnel. Beyond research, the primary export of the observatory are compasses, both ones that point north and ones that point to the observatory.
