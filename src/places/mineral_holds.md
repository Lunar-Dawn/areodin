# The Mineral Holds

Less islands and more floating mountains and hills the Mineral Holds are the source of almost all metals in Areodin.

## Geography


### The Great Hold {#great-hold}

The Mineral Holds are dominated by the Great Hold, a veritable mountain of an island. Surrounding it lie several smaller islands. A bit over 6 kilometres high the Great Hold is home to most of the population and harvesting of the holds. The mountain is divided into levels called "hearths" every few hundred metres, with people living on terraces carved around the outside. Each hearth is dedicated to a specific metal that grows in the caves near that level.

Embedded in the centre of the Great Hold is the crystal that supports the growth of minerals in the area.

### The minor holds

Surrounding the Great Hold are several smaller islands, most of which are simply quarried for their stone, but a few of them are dedicated to growing metals and minerals.

## History

The Holds were settled soon after [the Evacuation](/history/evacuation) was complete by a group of dwarves and cavern elves who wanted to establish a settlement more similar to their homes on the surface. The extensive settlement didn't start until almost a century after the Evacuation when demand for, and refinement capabilities of, metals started to pick up.

## Economy and Population

The economy of the Holds is centred almost entirely around the growing of metals and minerals, and the quarrying of stone. This is made possible by the crystal in the centre of the Great Hold, which channels power from the plane of Metal into the islands.

This influence means that if you plant a "seed" of a specific metal in the earth (usually an intricate metal rod) it will grow more of the metal on itself.
