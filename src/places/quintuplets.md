# The Quintuplets

Five large islands circling a crystal with a connection to the positive plane, the quintuplets are the breadbasket of Areodin.

## Geography

Almost unique in the world, the Quintuplets are five large, closely located islands of almost the same sizes; as compared to most other islands which are either a single small-to-medium-sized solitary island, a large-to-medium-sized island with much smaller satellite islands, or a flock of very small islands.

## History

## Economy and Population

The Quintuplets supply around 40% of the world's food production. This is made possible by the crystal around which the island float, which causes crops to grow at enormous speeds and be unusually nutritious.

## The Roseluck Horticultural Institute

Located on one of the Quintuplets is the Roseluck Horticultural Institute, the preeminent place of research into crops and food. Founded in the year 461 as an offshoot of the [Areodin Academy](/places/academy) and becoming fully independent of it after 75 years, the Roseluck Insitute hosts well over five thousand researchers in various fields.
