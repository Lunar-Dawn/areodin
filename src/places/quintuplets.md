# The Quintuplets

Five large islands circling a crystal with a connection to the positive plane, the quintuplets are the breadbasket of Areodin.

## Geography

Almost unique in the world, the Quintuplets are five large, closely located islands of almost the same sizes; as compared to most other islands which are either a single small-to-medium-sized solitary island, a large-to-medium-sized island with much smaller satellite islands, or a flock of very small islands.

## History

## Economy and Population

The Quintuplets supply around 40% of the world's food production. This is made possible by the crystal around which the island float, which causes crops to grow at enormous speeds and be unusually nutritious.
