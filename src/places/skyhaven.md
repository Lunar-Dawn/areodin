# Skyhaven

Skyhaven is the largest island in the world, the longest inhabited one, and the closest thing Areodin has to a capital. 

Skyhaven was the first place where people landed during [the Evacuation](/history/evacuation) and was the first settlement proper to be established after it. Situated on the largest single island in Areodin, the mainland and surrounding satellite islands are home to half of the world's population. With a centrally located orbit and massive population, Skyhaven now serves as the political and economic centre of Areodin.
