# Lufveria

Established around a crystal with a connection to the Plane of Air, Lufveria is the almost sole shipyard in Areodin. 

## Geography

Lufveria is a medium-sized solitary island, which has been thoroughly dug out to make space for ships under construction and repair. Almost the entire edge is jagged from the many docks carved into the sides.

## History

A small outpost has existed on Lufveria since only a few years after [the Evacuation](/history/evacuation) to replenish the balloons of airships. But once the shipbuilding industry outgrew [Skyhaven](./skyhaven) and lumber supplies started coming in from [Luin](./luin) airship production slowly moved over to Lufveria.

## Economy and Population

The Lufverian economy is dedicated almost entirely to the production, repair, and improvement of airships around Aerodin. The sails, hull, fittings, balloon casing, and other equipment of almost any airship were most likely made by an artisan in Lufveria.

Most unique among the exports of Lufveria is [Zephyrium](/general/glossary#zephyrium), which can only be produced by the crystal at the centre of the island, or by the smaller crystals that are copied from it.
