# The Crystal Grove

One of the most fantastical places in Areodin the Crystal Groves are the source of almost all gems, crystals, and jewellery in the world.

## Geography

The island is dominated by the cyan crystal forest from which it gets its name and the crystal peak at its centre but is otherwise an unremarkable medium-sized island.

## History

Initially settled by researchers to study the crystal trees and harvest them for magical crafting the island has over the centuries transitioned to a markedly more independent economy.

## Economy and Population

The island economy is based on the harvesting of crystals and gems from the trees around the island and the refinement of such.

The "fruits" of the crystalline trees are enabled by the central crystal peak and its connection to the Plane of Earth.
