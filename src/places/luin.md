# Luin

A moderately sized island surrounded by smaller ones, Luin is the majority source of lumber in Areodin.

## Geography

The central island is a medium-sized island almost entirely covered in a thick mixed forest. The exceptions are the port, town, and roads of the inhabitants and the crystal in the centre of the island, surrounded by the trunk of a massive tree.

Surrounding the central island are several smaller islands, each covered with a grove containing a specific type of tree.

## History

## Economy and Population

The economy of Luin is dominated by the harvest and basic refinement of wood. This is supported by the central crystal's connection to the Plane of Wood speeding up tree growth in the area.
