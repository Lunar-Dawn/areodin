Mechanically Areodin uses the standard Golarion collection of gods (mostly [the Gods of the Inner Sea](https://2e.aonprd.com/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=1), but not purely), but with specific Golarion-linked events of history removed. So Sarenrae is still the goddess of the Sun and part of the Prismatic Ray and Cayden Cailean is still a partying chainbreaker, but Sarenrae didn't imprison Rorvagug under Gormuz, and Cayden didn't ascend after going under Absalom to touch the Starstone.

Since this does leave some gods somewhat flavourless, if you want to play a Cleric, Champion, or other devout character feel free to talk to me and we can expand the specific lore of your chosen god.
