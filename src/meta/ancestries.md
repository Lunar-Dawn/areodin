# Ancestries

Many ancestries nearly or completely died out during [the Evacuation](/history/evacuation). This changed the Rarity of many ancestries and caused some to undergo drastic cultural changes.

## Ages

In this world, as in many of mine when I do writing and worldbuilding, many long-lived ancestries are not quite as long-lived as they are in some other D&D-descended fantasy. But still pretty long-lived.

At some point I will make a table for this, but in general, the difference from human lifespans is a bit below half of pf2e standard for long-lived ancestries. As an example, elves live for ((600-100) / 2 + 100) &asymp; 325 years and dwarves for ((350-100) / 2 + 100) &asymp; 225 years.
