# The Strix

How long the Strix have been up here no one quite knows, and their precise motives are mysterious, but they do not want us up here. They raid ships and settlements both with and without their own airships, and they leave none alive if they can help it.

Since knowledge of the Strix language is so rare all knowledge is based on the few writings that have been recovered from them. What has been recovered seems to indicate that they believe that the sky is their domain and that all the other peoples of Areodin are intruders. Whether this is religiously motivated or not remains to be determined.
