# Religion in Areodin

*See also [Religion (Meta)](/meta/religion)*

Although the majority of religions from before the Evacuation survive today, many of them have changed significantly in their worship and the number of adherents has shifted significantly. Three faiths have emerged as dominant throughout parts of Areodin

## The Church of the Prismatic Ray

With Sarenrae's domain over the daylight sky, Desna's domain over the stars, and Shelyn's desire for peace the Prismatic Ray has become the preeminent faith for daily worship in Areodin. Followers of the Ray can be found in all walks of life, and the trio are seen as a sort of patron for the new world above the clouds.

With such a wide following worship varies wildly between groups and goals. Sailors tend to pray to Desna that they find port safely, or that [the Wave](/general/glossary#the-wave) still lets them find new lands. Artists pray to Shelyn to inspire them and elevate their works to new heights. And farmers pray to Sarenrae to ensure the yields of their labours.

As the largest faith the Church of the Prismatic Ray does open its door to congregations of smaller deities in places where their followers do not have enough resources for their own temples. Worship of Cayden Cailean, Torag, and other smaller gods is common in their churches, as long as the deities are not outright evil.

## The Church of Abadar

The relatively extreme urbanisation of Areodin after the Evacuation has thrust the God of Cities into the forefront of many people's worship. His temples can be found on almost every town- and city-island across Areodin, protecting the inhabitants from storms and raids. However, the increase in city populations has not left Abadar or his rites unchanged. Abadar's dogged pursuit of wealth and law has mellowed out a small amount and refocused into a pursuit of general prosperity and harmony.

Abadar is also the patron god of many merchants and they often focus more on his older more wealth-centred aspects.

## Followers of Gozreh

Much less of an organized church than the Prismatic Ray or Abadar, worship of Gozreh is still very widespread. With her seas lost under the Mist worship of Gozreh now centres almost entirely on his winds and sky. Gozren Druids read the world through his winds, farmers make offerings for rain, and sailors pray for good winds. In fact, the masts and yards of almost all sailing airships are decorated in some way to his winds.

## Other Gods

Many other gods still have their followers and rites in certain situations, but a few have more notable followers in Areodin.

### Apsu

Although no longer the devout theocracy it was founded as, [the Sky-Roost](/places/sky_roost) and its inhabitants are still thoroughly devoted to their Dragon God. With religious fervour having faded into cultural tradition, the kobolds of the Sky-Roost are no longer as fanatical to the exclusion of other gods, but most do still give their service purely to Apsu.

### Erastil

As the god of farming and community, Erastil has a devoted following on [the Quintuplets](/places/quintuplets), where he watches over the crops and the villages that tend to them.

### Iomedae

Although not an explicitly Iomedaean group, the majority of the [Gryphon Knights](./gryphon_knights) do follow her to some extent. Despite her devout following in Areodin being small, their role as guardians grants her a strong presence across the world.

### Milani

Dating back to before the Evacuation, the Sesani of [Trit-Shi](/places/trit_shi) still view Milani as their patron goddess. With the persecution of tieflings but a horrible memory, worship of Milani has turned less militant and into an ongoing promise to never let such horrors befall anyone again.
