# Androids

Androids are relatively new to the world, only appearing after [the Evacuation](/history/evacuation). They rarely appear on small islands in the reaches of the world, with no real memory of their past. They are picked up and taken to [Skyhaven](/places/skyhaven) to integrate into Areodin society. Most still live in a small community in Skyhaven, but many are spread out into the wider world.

The leading theory is that they were created by the [Builders](./builders) as workers who could adapt to the new environment better, but opinions are split, especially amongst the androids themselves.
