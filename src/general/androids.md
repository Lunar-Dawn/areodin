# Androids

Androids are relatively new to the world, only appearing after [the Evacuation](/history/evacuation). They rarely wake up on small islands in the far reaches of the world, with no real memory of their past. They are picked up and taken to [Skyhaven](/places/skyhaven) to integrate into Areodin society. Many still live in a small community in Skyhaven, but many have also ventured out into the wider world.

The leading theory is that they were created by the [Builders](./builders) as workers who could adapt to the new environment better, but opinions are split, especially amongst the androids themselves.

## Android Names {#names}

Since all androids found so far have been found fully mature androids traditionally name themselves. It is even considered somewhat offensive to assign an android a name not of their own choosing; as such, androids very rarely have nicknames.

As they choose them themselves android names are very diverse. Many name themselves in the style of whatever crew or person found them as a sign of respect, others take inspiration from [the Quintuplets](/places/quintuplets) and name themselves with one or two meaningful words, and yet others simply make up a name themselves.

## Android souls, gems, and magic fields

Since androids are artificial beings made of dead materials it would normally be impossible for them to utilise magic, or to have a soul attached to them. But embedded on or in (usually at the nape of the neck, the centre of the sternum, or where a humanoid's heart would be) every android there is a magical gem that projects a magic field around them. The field lets them interact with magic, and anchors the soul they have been proven to possess.

The artificial nature of this field has several interesting consequences, such as an increased maleability. It is also possible, but difficult, to implant such a gem into another person who already has a natural magic field, to provide them with a smaller malleable field.
