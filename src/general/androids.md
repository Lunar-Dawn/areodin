# Androids

Androids are relatively new to the world, only appearing after [the Evacuation](/history/evacuation). They rarely appear on small islands in the reaches of the world, with no real memory of their past. They are picked up and taken to [Skyhaven](/places/skyhaven) to integrate into Areodin society. Most still live in a small community in Skyhaven, but many are spread out into the wider world.

The leading theory is that they were created by the [Builders](./builders) as workers who could adapt to the new environment better, but opinions are split, especially amongst the androids themselves.

## Android Names {#names}

Since all androids found so far have been found fully mature androids traditionally name themselves. It is even considered somewhat offensive to assign an android a name not of their own choosing; as such, androids very rarely have nicknames.

As they choose them themselves android names are very diverse. Many name themselves in the style of whatever crew or person found them as a sign of respect, others take inspiration from [the Quintuplets](/places/quintuplets) and name themselves with one or two meaningful words, and yet others simply make up a name themselves.
