# The Builders

Not much is known about the people who raised the islands Areodin rests on today. Definite facts are rare and opinions are split, but a few facts are generally agreed upon:

- They must have had great magical abilities.
- They must have had a lot of resources.
- They intended for people to live on the islands without support from the surface.
- They most likely had some knowledge of the Mist before it arrived.
    - Their disappearance was almost certainly related to the arrival of the mist.
    - Their disappearance was almost certainly unplanned
