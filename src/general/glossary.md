# Glossary

A glossary of common terms that are used on this website and in Areodin.

### AE & BE

### The Bob

A sailor tern for the instability experienced when flying an airship above a floating island. The effect varies based on the difference in weight between the bodies. Ranges from an annoyance to a catastrophic loss of control.

### The Veil and the Wave

The colloquial term for the time and distance variance of unobserved islands respectively. Scales by relative knowledge about the island and desire to be found. The Veil means that isolated islands sometimes drift out of time with others and the wave means that finding a specific island without any information or direction is nearly impossible.

### Zephyrium

An inert alchemo-magical lighter-than-air gas produced in [Lufveria](/places/lufveria). Injected into a foam (to prevent leakage from a single hole) inside airship balloons to provide lift. The slight decay over time is replenished onboard by a crystal cloned from the primary one on Lufveria.
