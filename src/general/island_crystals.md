# The Island Crystals

In the centre of all\* known islands larger\*\* than approximately 100 metres is embedded a large magically infused crystal. These crystals appear to serve three main purposes.

* Allow larger islands to float in the air.
* Replenish soil nutrients and "regrow" the island as pieces fall off.
* Refill and contain the water table on the island.

A lot of the crystals embedded in islands also have extra enchantments on them, providing some extra benefit to the inhabitants. Some hypothesise that *all* crystals have effects like these and that the functions of the others have simply not been discovered yet, but this is a fairly unpopular hypothesis since extensive investigations have turned up no traces.

| Island                                     | Effect                                                                            |

| [Skyhaven](/places/skyhaven)               | Reduced caloric need of inhabitants                                               |
| [The Mineral Holds](/places/mineral_holds) | Rapidly growing metal crystals and stone                                          |
| [The Quintuplets](/places/quintuplets)     | Massively improved crop growth rate and nutrition                                 |
| [Grefor](/places/grefor)                   | Heats the forges to temperatures enough to smelt adamantium and mithril           |
| [Lufveria](/places/lufveria)               | Emits an alchemical reagent used to make [Zephyrium](/general/glossary#zephyrium) |
| [The Crystal Grove](/places/crystal_grove) | Grows crystaline trees that bear gems and crystals as fruit                       |
| [Luin](/places/luin)                       | Speeds up tree growth and quality                                                 |
| [Aerodin Academy](/places/academy)         | Stores an enormous amount of information of all types and media                   |

As one can see, these effects are very diverse and very explicitly give each island a designated purpose. The exact reason the [Builders](./builders) made the crystals this way is unknown, but the leading theory is that a single crystal simply can't do it all.

*\* [The Quintuplets](/places/quintuplets) are a notable exception, sharing a single crystal between them.*\
*\*\* Singular larger islands with satellites appear to "extend" the central crystal's effect to the satellites.*

## The (missing) planar crystals

Six of these crystals, the ones in The Mineral Holds, The Quintuplets, Grefor, Lufveria, The Crystal Grove, and Luin are connected to six of the Inner Sphere planes (metal, positive, fire, air, earth, and wood respectively). The astute reader will notice that two planes are missing from this list, the Plane of Water and the Negative Energy Plane. Where these islands are, and if they even exist has confounded explorers in the centuries since the last of the known planar crystals were found.

Of these two, the absence of a Water Crystal is the more interesting one. Since a connection to the Negative Energy plane would be unlikely to be useful it is usually assumed that such a crystal would simply not have been made. But why a Water crystal was never made, or where it has disappeared to if it does exist is a centuries-long mystery.
