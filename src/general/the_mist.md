# The Mist

Ever since [the Evacuation](/history/evacuation) the surface of the world has been covered in an approximately seven kilometres thick mist. The upper few kilometres are indistinguishable from normal clouds, but as one gets lower down the mist and its effects get strange. At the surface, the Mist turns into a thick green soup, it blocks out all sunlight and limits visibility to only a few metres. But stranger still are the effects it has on living creatures...

## Mist-Beasts

Living creatures exposed to the mist slowly warp beyond recognition. On shorter time scales (a few days to a week at a time) the body seems capable of withstanding it and recovering, but longer exposure warps the body into grotesque shapes and the mind into savage rage. There is no known cure once symptoms appear.

Strangely dwarves seem resistant (but **not immune**) to the effects, and can survive for about twice as long without negative consequences.

The mist has also spread many more hazards across the surface such as areas where the air is more immediately toxic, and pools of liquefied mist.

Rarely do beasts from the mist acquire the ability to fly, and can then pose a danger to the people of Areodin. These incursions are usually dealt with by the [Gryphon Knights](./gryphon_knights). Even more rarely these flying creatures come in a great wave.

## Mist-divers

Despite these risks, many brave people still take the risk and venture into the mist in search of relics and information from the past. The life expectancy is not high and after only half a dozen dives most will have to retire lest they get permanent symptoms.
