# Languages in Areodin

## Hittipo

Of the many things left behind after [the Evacuation](/history/evacuation) the languages of the old world are some of the most noticeable ones. After the Evacuation was complete [Skyhaven](/places/skyhaven) was left with several thousand with no universal shared language. Fortunately, through many layers of translation, everyone was able to communicate with each other, albeit inefficiently. What eventually came from this hodgepodge was Hittipo, a creole composed of several old-world languages that was codified by a group of linguists before it evolved as a standard language. It now serves as the near-universal lingua franca of Areodin.

## Other Languages

Although Hittipo is by far the predominant language in Areodin, multiple other languages still survive today.

### Tesserian

Tesserian (today often called "Ol' Tesserian") is a language from before the Evacuation and was one of the most widespread languages in the old world. The primary reason for its survival today is that most of the very sparse writing that exists from [the Builders](./builders) has been written in Tesserian.

### Ses-ti

Another old-world language, Ses-ti is almost solely spoken on [Trit-Shi](/places/trit_shi) by the Sesani that moved there after the Evacuation. As they were a unified cultural group before the Evacuation they kept their native language and never truly adopted Hittipo, but trade and diplomacy do mean that many Sesani do still learn Hittipo.

### Elven

Even in the more cosmopolitan world after the Evacuation the elves still keep their old culture in high regard. Combined with their [long lifespans](/meta/ancestries#ages) meaning fewer generations have lived above the clouds it means that the elven language is still commonly spoken by them. Although almost all elves *do* speak Hittipo, being able to converse, or at least deliver greetings in Elven is often seen as a sign of respect.

#### Other ancestral Languages

Most of the other ancestral languages (such as Dwarven, Goblin, and Halfling) are not lost, but learning them is done out of curiosity or respect, and their use as mother tounges is pretty much extinct.

### Draconic

With their relatively independent culture and specific traditions, the Kobolds of [Sky-Roost](/places/sky_roost) have preserved Draconic as their native tongue. While most Kobolds do speak Hittipo, there is a not-insignificant proportion of them that never learned it.

### Celestial

Still the liturgical language of the Church of the Dawnflower, most non-martial anointed followers of Sarenrae know Celestial. But with the shrinking of the church following the Evacuation its necessity as a cross-cultural language has diminished greatly.

### Strix

Strix is only of interest to those who seek to understand the [Strix](./strix) and their raids, and proficiency is thus almost purely held by academics. But for those with an interest in the Strix it is invaluable.

### Auran

After taking to the skies society has started coming into contact with a significantly higher number of air elementals. Proficiency in Auran has thus risen as well, but it is still very rarely known.
